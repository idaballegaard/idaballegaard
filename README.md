<br />

🎨💻 Web developer with a strong focus on the intersection of **programming, design, and UX**.

I’m driven by creating **well-rounded digital solutions** where code doesn’t just work — it supports a meaningful and intuitive user experience.

I believe the best products are built where **logic meets aesthetics** and where technology serves both the user and the business.

## 🧠 About Me
I’m currently studying **Web Development** at [Syddansk Erhvervsakademi](chatgpt://generic-entity?number=0).  
My specialization lies in frontend development, combined with hands-on experience in backend development.

I enjoy translating ideas, wireframes, and user insights into **functional, accessible, and visually cohesive solutions**.  
My work is driven by clarity, attention to detail, and a strong understanding of how users interact with digital products — from interface to logic.

I value thoughtful problem-solving and see code as a tool to support both usability and long-term maintainability.
